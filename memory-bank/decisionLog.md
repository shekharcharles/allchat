## Decision

*

## Rationale

*
[2025-06-18 21:34:20] - Updated Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) to include `provider`, `model`, `messageCount`, `updatedAt`, `lastProvider`, and `lastModel` fields in `ChatSession` and `ChatMessage` models to support LLM-related data and session metrics. This was necessary after refactoring `app/api/chat/messages/route.ts` to use Prisma, which required these fields for data consistency.
[2025-06-18 21:34:20] - Refactored `app/api/chat/messages/route.ts` to fully leverage Prisma ORM for all database operations (creating sessions/messages, updating session counts, fetching messages). This replaces direct MongoDB client calls to improve connection pooling and database interaction efficiency.
[2025-06-18 21:34:20] - Identified and addressed the `PrismaClientKnownRequestError: P2031` which required the MongoDB server to be run as a replica set for Prisma transactions. Confirmed with the user that the MongoDB server has been configured as a replica set.
[2025-06-18 21:34:20] - Created `postcss.config.js` and explicitly defined `content` paths in `tailwind.config.ts` to resolve reported "broken CSS" issues by ensuring proper PostCSS and Tailwind CSS processing.

## Implementation Details

*   [2025-06-18 22:14:45] - **Decision:** Implemented file attachment support using MongoDB GridFS for binary file storage and Prisma ORM for managing file metadata. This involved creating a new `FileMetadata` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` and refactoring file upload/download API routes (`/api/files/upload`, `/api/files/download/[fileId]`) to interact with GridFS via a custom MongoDB client instance and Prisma.
    *   **Rationale:** GridFS is a suitable choice for storing large binary files (like images and PDFs) within a MongoDB environment, avoiding the overhead of separate file systems or cloud storage for this project's scope. Prisma provides a type-safe and consistent way to manage the associated metadata, integrating well with the existing data layer. This approach keeps the data layer unified within MongoDB while leveraging Prisma's benefits for structured data.
    *   **Implications:** Requires a dedicated MongoDB client instance for GridFS operations alongside Prisma for metadata. Ensures referential integrity between `User` and `FileMetadata` models. Allows for efficient file serving and management directly through API endpoints.
*   [2025-06-18 22:25:00] - **Re-emergent Issue:** The `PrismaClientKnownRequestError: P2031` (MongoDB replica set requirement) has re-emerged. This indicates that despite previous attempts, the MongoDB server is either not configured correctly as a replica set, or the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file does not correctly reflect a replica set connection string (e.g., missing `replicaSet` parameter in the connection string if a direct connection is used instead of a connection to a replica set host).
    *   **Rationale:** Prisma operations, particularly transactions involved in `create()` and `update()` calls, require the underlying MongoDB server to be running as a replica set for data consistency guarantees.
    *   **Action Required:** Re-verify MongoDB replica set configuration and `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
*   [2025-06-19 20:58:12] - **Decision:** Moved destructuring of `sessionId` from `params` to occur before any `await` calls in `app/api/chat/rename/[sessionId]/route.ts` and `app/api/chat/delete/[sessionId]/route.ts`.
    *   **Rationale:** Resolved the Next.js warning/error: `Route "/api/chat/rename/[sessionId]" used \`params.sessionId\`. \`params\` should be awaited before using its properties.` This ensures `params` is accessed synchronously and avoids potential issues with dynamic APIs in newer Next.js versions.
    *   **Implications:** Improves stability of chat session management API routes.
