*   Refactored `app/api/chat/messages/route.ts` to use Prisma for database operations.
*   Refactored `app/api/chat/sessions/route.ts` to use Prisma for database operations.
*   Created `postcss.config.js` and explicitly defined `content` paths in `tailwind.config.ts` to resolve CSS rendering issues.
*   [x] Ensured MongoDB is running as a replica set (resolved P2031 error after updating `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` and confirming replica set setup).
*   Resolved `EADDRINUSE` error by terminating the process on port 3000.
*   Successfully restarted the Next.js development server.
*   Resolved TypeScript errors in `app/chat/page.tsx` (updated `target` to `esnext` in `tsconfig.json` and removed duplicate variable declarations).

*   Modified `ChatMessageContent` component to display file references in `app/chat/page.tsx`.
