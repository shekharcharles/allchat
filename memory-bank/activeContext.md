[2025-06-18 22:08:47] - Current Focus: Resolved JSX syntax errors and `tsconfig.json` configuration issues in `app/chat/page.tsx`. Successfully integrated file attachment display within the `ChatMessageContent` component. Next: Refine UI/UX for file uploads.
[2025-06-18 22:11:18] - Recent Changes: Implemented robust client-side validation for file types and sizes in `app/chat/page.tsx`. Added visual feedback (spinner) for file uploads.
[2025-06-18 22:13:20] - Recent Changes: Implemented download links for attached files in `app/chat/page.tsx`, completing the core "Attachment Support (File Uploads)" feature. UI/UX refinements, including client-side validation and visual feedback during uploads, are now integrated.
[2025-06-18 22:13:20] - Current Focus: Completed Attachment Support (File Uploads) feature. Moving to next task.
[2025-06-18 22:46:15] - Recent Changes: Resolved the `PrismaClientKnownRequestError: P2031` by correctly configuring the MongoDB replica set and updating the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
[2025-06-18 22:46:15] - Open Questions/Issues: New error: `AI Error: 401 Incorrect API key provided`. This means the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file is invalid or missing.
[2025-06-18 23:04:30] - Current Focus: Configuring the application to use an OpenAI-compatible API. This requires obtaining the user's specific API key and the base URL for their Litellm/custom 'New-API' service.
[2025-06-18 23:04:30] - Open Questions/Issues: Awaiting user to provide the actual OpenAI-compatible API key and its corresponding base URL for configuration in `.env` and `app/api/chat/completions/route.ts`.
[2025-06-19 15:30:27] - Current Focus: Implementing chat session management (delete and rename).
[2025-06-19 15:30:27] - Recent Changes: Added `onDelete: Cascade` to `ChatMessage` in `prisma/schema.prisma`. Implemented backend API routes for chat deletion (`app/api/chat/delete/[sessionId]/route.ts`) and renaming (`app/api/chat/rename/[sessionId]/route.ts`). Implemented frontend UI and logic for delete and rename in `components/layout/chat-sidebar.tsx`.
[2025-06-19 15:30:27] - Recent Changes: Addressed `Error: Route "/api/chat/rename/[sessionId]" used \`params.sessionId\`. \`params\` should be awaited before using its properties.` by moving `sessionId` destructuring to before `await getServerSession` in both `app/api/chat/rename/[sessionId]/route.ts` and `app/api/chat/delete/[sessionId]/route.ts`.
[2025-06-19 15:30:27] - Open Questions/Issues: Awaiting user confirmation on chat management functionality after server restart.
